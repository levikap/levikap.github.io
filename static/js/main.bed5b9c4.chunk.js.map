Additionally, our finding that images of children are delivered more to women can \n            reinforce certain stereotypes, and images of young women being delivered mostly to men could run counter to diversity \n            goals an advertiser may have when deciding to include pictures of women in their ads. \n            Our results show the importance of carefully considering the biases that a system may have, \n            as nefarious harms can present themselves in subtle ways.\n            <br></br>\n            &emsp;I presented this work at the Internet Measurement Conference 2022, where it was awarded the Best Paper Award.\n            <br></br>\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\">Press Coverage</div>\n              <div className=\"paragraph\">Gizmodo: \n              <br></br>\n                &emsp;\n                  <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebook-meta-photos-ads-race-gender-age-study-1849706492\">\n                <u>Facebook Segments Ads by Race and Age Based on Photos Whether Advertisers Want It or Not, Study Says</u>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n\n            </div>\n            <br></br>\n            \n             <br></br>\n            <div className=\"SectionTitle\">Data Deserts and Black Boxes</div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">\n              &emsp;My work on this project involved investigating the fairness and equality of a prominent data broker. \n              We wondered whether the coverage and accuracy of their data were equal among different demographic and socioeconomic groups, \n              which is vitally important because data broker data is used to verify people as part of background checks for housing and employment. \n              It has been reported that a lack of coverage has led to being given higher prices for insurance and disadvantageous loans, \n              and being denied access to jobs, homes, and COVID-19 vaccines. \n              To investigate the coverage and accuracy of their data, we purchased information from the data broker that was available in public voter records, \n              enabling us to compare Experian’s data to ground-truth voter record information. \n              We were interested in whether voters in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups were particularly impacted by lower coverage and accuracy in their data. \n              We found that ethnic minorities, young people, and those living in lower income areas were less likely to appear in the database; \n              if they were, their data were more likely to be inaccurate. \n              Additionally, we used regression to show that, even holding constant an individual’s age and gender, and local poverty rates, ethnic minorities still have lower coverage. \n              Our results suggest that marginalized groups could be disadvantaged in passing background checks or applying for mortgages and other loans.\t\n              This work was accepted to Management Science.</div>\n            <br></br>\n\n\n            <div className=\"SectionTitle\"><a href={AlgColor} target=\"_blank\"><u>Algorithms that \"Don't See Color\"</u></a></div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">\n              &emsp;This research involved looking into Facebook's delivery of federally protected advertisements.\n              In 2019 following a settlement in court, Facebook agreed to remove demographic attributes\n               from targeting options for the federally protected advertising categories of\n               Housing, Credit, and Employment. This work sought to investigate the extent to which\n               this technique of simply removing the demographic attributes actually reduced the algorithm\n               delivering the ads to demographics at different rates.\n               We found that the updated algorithm for delivering to protected advertising categories\n               did little to reduce the demographic biases for gender, age, race, and political leanings.\n               This suggests that merely removing demographic features from the inputs of real-world\n               algorithmic systems can fail to remove biased outputs.\n            </div>\n              \n            <br></br>\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\">Press Coverage</div>\n              <div className=\"paragraph\">Governor Lael Brainard for the Federal Reserve: \n              <br></br>\n                &emsp;\n                  <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210112a.htm\">\n                <u>Supporting Responsible Use of AI and Equitable Outcomes in Financial Services</u>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">ProPublica: \n              <br></br>\n              &emsp;\n                <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-ads-can-still-discriminate-against-women-and-older-workers-despite-a-civil-rights-settlement\">\n              <u>Facebook Ads Can Still Discriminate Against Women and Older Workers, Despite a Civil Rights Settlement</u>\n                </a>\n            </div>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n        </div>\n    )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Research\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport Paper from '../assets/alg_dont_see_color.pdf';\n\nclass Publications extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return(\n        <div className=\"about\">\n            <div className=\"SectionTitle\">Published Papers</div>\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\">2023</div>\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\">Data Deserts and Black Boxes: The Impact of Socio-Economic Status on Consumer Profiling</div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">&emsp;Nico Neumann, Catherine Tucker, <b>Levi Kaplan</b>, Alan Mislove, and Piotr Sapiezynski.</div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">&emsp;To be published in Management Science.</div>\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n\n\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\">2022</div>\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\"><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517745.3561450\"><u>Measurement and Analysis of Implied Identity in Ad Delivery Optimization</u></a></div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\"><b>Awards:</b> Best Paper Award, IMC 2022</div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">&emsp;<b>Levi Kaplan</b>, Nicole Gerzon, Alan Mislove, and Piotr Sapiezynski. \"Measurement and analysis of implied identity in ad delivery optimization.\" In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 195-209. 2022.</div>\n            <br></br>\n\n\n            <div className=\"SubsectionTitle\"><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514094.3534135\"><u>Algorithms that \"Don't See Color\":\n            Comparing Biases in Lookalike and Special Ad Audiences</u></a></div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\"><b>Awards:</b> Runner-up, Best Student Paper Award, ConPro 2022</div>\n            <div className=\"paragraph\">&emsp;Piotr Sapiezynski, Avijit Ghosh, <b>Levi Kaplan</b>, Aaron Rieke, and Alan Mislove. 2022.
