Prior studies have shown that the image in the ad by itself has a powerful effect on its delivery. An image related to bodybuilding is delivered almost exclusively to men, and another image related to makeup is delivered almost exclusively to women, even when both ads are targeting an identical, gender-balanced audience. We speculated: would a similar skew also be present when changing the demographics of people appearing in the ad?",Object(g.jsx)("br",{}),"\u2003For our study, we collected stock photos of Black people and white people of different ages and genders. To control for noise introduced by varied facial expressions, postures, backgrounds, and clothing, we also developed a novel methodology to create consistent computer-generated faces using StyleGAN. After running these two sets of ads, we found the following results: images of Black people were delivered significantly more to Black Facebook users when compared to images of white people; images of older people are delivered much more to older Facebook users; images of children are delivered much more to women; and images of teen women are delivered much more to older men. We performed a second experiment, which involved adding both a background to the image and link to a job site for different jobs, such as \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d or \u201cLumber.\u201d We found that, consistent with prior work, ads in different industries show significant differences along racial and gender lines, such as janitorial ads being delivered disproportionately to Black women. We also found a congruent skew along racial lines, which means that images with Black people in the ad are more likely to be delivered to Black users, with the amount of skew varying depending on the job. Our findings are significant in showing the effect that the image of a person placed in an ad has on its delivery. We show that including historically underrepresented groups in ads can help to show that ad to more diverse audiences, which could help to reverse inequities, although the type of job does influence which audience that ad is shown to. Conversely, a non-diverse ad could be more harmful than previously thought, because in addition to prior research showing minority individuals being less responsive to these ads, the ad platform may not even show these ads to them to begin with. Additionally, our finding that images of children are delivered more to women can reinforce certain stereotypes, and images of young women being delivered mostly to men could run counter to diversity goals an advertiser may have when deciding to include pictures of women in their ads.

It has been reported that a lack of coverage has led to being given higher prices for insurance and disadvantageous loans, and being denied access to jobs, homes, and COVID-19 vaccines. To investigate the coverage and accuracy of their data, we purchased information from the data broker that was available in public voter records, enabling us to compare Experian\u2019s data to ground-truth voter record information. We were interested in whether voters in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups were particularly impacted by lower coverage and accuracy in their data. We found that ethnic minorities, young people, and those living in lower income areas were less likely to appear in the database; if they were, their data were more likely to be inaccurate. Additionally, we used regression to show that, even holding constant an individual\u2019s age and gender, and local poverty rates, ethnic minorities still have lower coverage. Our results suggest that marginalized groups could be disadvantaged in passing background checks or applying for mortgages and other loans.
